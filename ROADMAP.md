# ROADMAP: Become a Sui Move Developer

Welcome! This roadmap is your step-by-step guide to mastering **Sui Move** â€” the smart contract language used on the Sui blockchain. We begin with foundational blockchain concepts, and gradually build toward full-stack decentralized application (dApp) development on Sui.

> All concepts are aligned with [Sui Docs](https://docs.sui.io), [The Move Book](https://move-book.com), and the [Sui Foundationâ€™s Intro Course](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course).
